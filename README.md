# unveiling-sales-performance
Interactive Tableau dashboards and analysis exploring county-level sales performance, employee ratings, and key business insights.
A Data Visualization Project Using Tableau with What-If Analysis

---

## Project Overview
This project explores the factors influencing sales performance across counties, including employee satisfaction, individual performance metrics, and other relevant variables. Using **Tableau and What-If analysis**, the project allows stakeholders to simulate different scenarios and understand the potential impact of changes in key metrics. The goal is to provide actionable insights for senior management to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and drive organizational growth.

## Goals / Objectives
- Analyze the relationship between sales performance (outcome variable) and influencing factors such as employee satisfaction and performance metrics.  
- Identify key drivers of sales success at county and employee levels.  
- Build **interactive dashboards** with filters, drill-downs, and scenario simulations to enable dynamic exploration of insights.  
- Provide data-driven recommendations for strategic planning and resource optimization.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Handling missing values, normalizing datasets, and preparing data for visualization.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncover trends, correlations, and patterns across counties and employee metrics.  
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboards:** Filters, highlights, and drill-downs for dynamic insights exploration.  
- **What-If Analysis:** Simulate different scenarios to evaluate how changes in employee performance, satisfaction, or resource allocation affect sales outcomes.  

- **Data Storytelling:** Clear visualizations and dashboards designed to communicate actionable insights to senior management.
